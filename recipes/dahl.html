        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>To be clear, I hate this part of most of the recipe webpage. 
            No, Jennifer, I do not want to hear your life story about this
            no bake cheesecake.
        </p>
        <p>Anyways, if I had to say something, it would be that I wanted
            to make some vegan food that was high in protein, and red lentils
            stuck out as something to incorporate. I wanted to boost the protein
            content even further, so I added tofu. Enjoy!
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>375g red lentils</li>
                <li>400ml low fat coconut milk</li>
                <li>400ml tinned tomatoes</li>
                <li>500ml vegetable stock</li>
                <li>400g brown onion</li>
                <li>600g tofu</li>
                <li>1 tbs garam masala</li>
                <li>1 tsp tumeric</li>
                <li>2 tsp chilli powder</li>
                <li>
                    lemon juice (I literally always
                    forget this)
                </li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Dice onions and tofu, and place in separate bowls</li>
                <li>
                    Heat a large saucepan and add onions. Brown, occasionally 
                    added tablespoons of water as needed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add in tofu and spices.
                </li>
                <li>
                    add in coconut milk, tinned tomatoes, vegetable stock.
                    Bring to boil, stirring frequently. Let simmer for 30 minutes
                    or until the lentils have absorbed most of the liquid, stirring
                    occasionally.
                </li>
                <li> 
                    Realise that somewhere down the line you were meant to
                    to add lemon juice, but didn't.
                </li>
            </ol>
