        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Yeah, yeah, I know the actual spanish term for it would
            be chilli sin carne. But who doesn't love a good pun, right?
        </p>
        <p>This recipe is essentially the same as a regular chilli 
            con carne, but subbing out the mince for some meat
            subsitute mince. No more having to follow overly complicated
            recipes having you shred, smoke, bake and shake some poor
            tofu so that it resembles mince.
        </p>
